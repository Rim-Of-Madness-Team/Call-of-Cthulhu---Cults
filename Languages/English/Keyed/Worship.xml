<GameOverCallToDarkness>As the congregation continue their chant for what seems ages, the smell of earth begins to fill the air. Then without a sound, the earth splits apart.\n\nSluggishly, the temple begins to sloppily slide, carried along black muck -- ever downwards. With greater depth comes a loss of light and the sky above. The walls of earth begin to give way to thick stones and loose bones. A great time passes. They reach their final destination, nested in a mound of skeletons, and the only light is reflected from thousands of ravenous eyes. When the congregation lights a torch, the eyes scatter and leave only the cyclopian, unmoving visage of the Great Old One, Tsathoggua himself.\n\nThe silence breaks when black ichor wraps around the cultists from above and below, silent screams bubble inside thickened liquid. After a few moments the bubbles cease and silence again fills the void. In time, their now motionless forms will rise again, and the cult will continue to serve --\n\n--just not as they had imagined.</GameOverCallToDarkness>

	<GameOverSummonCthulhu>At the crescendo of the ritual you feel a great power rising. Your chants increase in fervor and almost seem to multiply in number - as if you can hear petitioners from countless other worlds echo your own chant.\n\nIn retrospect you cannot recall quite when you were successful. Time, space, your own sense of self, ceased to be of significance. But you know now that the great one has arisen! Cthulhu is now no longer slumbering in his great city of R'lyeh. As a being beyond the simply material his presence and form is manifold. Will you be deemed faithful enough to be worthy of glimpsing his physical embodiment before your mind is ripped asunder?\n\nEven now you struggle to maintain any level of lucidity as the laws by which the universe operates lapse into fantasy.\n\nYou've summoned Cthulhu! These colonists were first to be destroyed after his coming:\n\n{0}</GameOverSummonCthulhu>

    <GameOverOrthogenesis>The changes were slow and subtle at first. A loss of hair, a slight enlarging of the eyes, a growing greyish pallor of the skin. Some were more advanced than others and had small gill like slits appear. It was clear your genetic destiny wasn’t aligned with the rest of mankind's.\n\nNow you hear the distant croaking of your newfound kindred. That sound that once made the night frightful, now feels familiar and welcoming. They are calling you home. You look at your belongings but decide to leave them behind. You won’t need them where you are going.\n\nWith the blessing of the great Father and Mother, who rule beneath the waves, you are now to join your brethren.\n\nThese colonists were lost to the waves:\n\n{0}</GameOverOrthogenesis>

    <GameOverTransdimensionalConvergence>I make the signs, I speak the words\nthat openeth the door!\nCome forth I say, I turn the Key,\nNow ! walk the Earth once more !\n\nYou call her from the void.You call her away from the side of the Not-to-Be-Named-One. \n\nIn the skies above you see a mist burst though, as if through a crack in the sky. Tendrils of a cloud-like substance reach down, which gives birth to eyes, teeth and limbs in a melange of biological excess.\n\nYou've opened the way for Shub Niggurath to take over your universe. These colonists were first to be destroyed after her coming\n\n{0}</GameOverTransdimensionalConvergence>

    <GameOverPilgrimageToKadath>For the last few weeks the dreams have been getting stronger and more vivid. The real world began to pale in comparison. You would close your eyes to see its magnificent marble spires and silver fountains - the dream city of Kadath. There were those that thought that these visions were not real or that they were a lure for some trap. Even if that were true, you know you would still have sought it out.\n\nAnd now Nyarlathotep has come to guide you to this paradise.\n\nNyarlathotep forced your colonists to sleep and visit Kadath. Therein, these colonists viewed Azathoth before promptly being destroyed from the madness that followed:\n\n{0}</GameOverPilgrimageToKadath>
