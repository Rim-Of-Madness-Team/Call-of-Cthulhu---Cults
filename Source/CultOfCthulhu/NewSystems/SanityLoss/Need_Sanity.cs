/*    If individuals experience strange circumstances, they will lose sanity. 
    This insanity can spread like a virus in colonies without good social networks,
    outlets for expression, or anti-psychotics, as rejection to express onesself will
    further increase sanity loss. When sanity loss reaches its lowest threshold, 
    the character is permanently marked by madness and receives an insanity trait.
    Changed forever, when other colonists observe this individual marked with insanity,
    they too will be affected with sanity loss -- and so begins the spiral into madness.*/
