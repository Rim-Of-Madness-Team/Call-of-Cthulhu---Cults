Gameplay expansion for RimWorld.

    You can now:
        *found a cult
        *worship monstrous deities
        *make offerings and animal sacrifices
        *make human sacrifices in return for powerful spells (over 20 in total, plus a dozen side effects)

Thank you to my Patrons for supporting me in my efforts. Without you, none of this would be possible.
