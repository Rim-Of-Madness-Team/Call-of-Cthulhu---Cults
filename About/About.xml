[h1]Tips:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Cult-mindedness is a new feature under 'needs' that keeps track of how likely colonists are to become cultists.
[*] Better apparel means greater worship results and higher success rates for your sacrifices.
[*] Beware! If too many colonists are plotting against the cult, they might take matters into their own hands.

[*] Added support for Combat Extended
[*] Removed the production-tag on altars so they can be used in thronerooms
[*] Added an option to make sermons voluntary, making pawns complete some types of jobs before joining
[*] Improved the sermon scheduling with some inspiration from the excellent mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1565942758]Colony Leadership[/url] Now you can select what days to do sermons and also when they should start in the day.
