    <label>black ichor</label>
    <description>Ichor can be a liquid that runs through the veins of the gods. The true origin of this black ichor, however, is a mystery.\n\nIt is abysmal to behold, dark and black like a bottomless pit. Its texture is coagulated in places with the consistency of sausages hiding in very light sauces. The smell is not quite nauseating, as the smell bears just a hint of what one would find in a dark cave. Strangest of all is the taste. Once it touches the tongue, all of the irksome properties transform into a delightful honey-flavor, and the thickened portions taste of sweetmeats.\n\nThis thick soupy black ichor nourishes and invigorates followers of Tsathoggua at the cost of very little sanity loss.</description>
