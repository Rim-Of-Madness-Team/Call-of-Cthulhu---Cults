# Recommended mods
- 	Cosmic Horrors (for summoning actual monsters)

-      Realistic Darkness (for great darkness)

# How do I start a cult?

	1) Load the mod.
	2) Play for a few days in-game.
	3) One of your pawns will investigate something horrendous.
	4) Build the forbidden research center.
	5) Research the strange symbols until someone founds the cult.
	6) Good luck.
	
# Tips:
-  Cult-mindedness is a new feature under 'needs' that keeps track of how likely colonists are to become cultists.
-  Better apparel means greater worship results and higher success rates for your sacrifices.
-  Beware! If too many colonists are plotting against the cult, they might take matters into their own hands.

# Ideology Note:
This version of Cults contains unaltered classic gameplay from the original Call of Cthulhu - Cults mod. In consideration of the new expansion pack for RimWorld, Ideologies, we are considering a new Cults mod to work with Ideologies while maintaining this original package as well for those who prefer this classic style.
